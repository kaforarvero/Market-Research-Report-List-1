<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully Automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) market is primarily categorized into semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated AEDs require some user intervention, prompting the operator to deliver a shock, typically after analyzing the heart rhythm. In contrast, fully automated AEDs handle all steps independently, including shock delivery without user input. Both types are designed to provide crucial life-saving intervention in cardiac arrest situations, but the choice between them often depends on the users' training level and the anticipated emergency environment.</p></p>
