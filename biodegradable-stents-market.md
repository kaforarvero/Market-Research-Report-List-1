<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li><li>Metal Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodegradable stents market is primarily categorized into two types: polymer-based bioabsorbable stents and metal-based bioabsorbable stents. Polymer-based stents are crafted from biocompatible materials that gradually dissolve in the body, reducing the risk of long-term complications. In contrast, metal-based stents utilize bioabsorbable metals that maintain structural integrity for a certain period before being absorbed, allowing for effective support and controlled drug delivery. Both types aim to enhance patient outcomes by minimizing the need for permanent implants and facilitating natural healing.</p></p>
