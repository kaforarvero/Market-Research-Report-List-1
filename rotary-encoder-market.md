<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Rotary Encoders</li><li>Absolute Rotary Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary encoder market consists primarily of two types: incremental and absolute rotary encoders. Incremental rotary encoders generate a series of pulses as the shaft rotates, allowing for relative position tracking. They are often used in applications where speed and direction need to be monitored, but exact position isn't crucial. In contrast, absolute rotary encoders provide a unique position value for each shaft angle, ensuring precise location data even after power loss. This makes them ideal for applications requiring reliable and precise positioning.</p></p>
